## Requirements
To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evaluation
- (A) To obtain the evaluation results of the algorithms, uncomment the corresponding code in "Neurips2021_experiments.py" and execute it.
- (B) To repeat the empirical comparison of the two lower bounds (Prop. 4.1 and Thm 5.2) for the single 
bandit case (m=k), simply execute "NeurIPS_LB_comparison.py".

## Results
- After repeating all experiments in (A), the results shown in the tables are written saved the following files

|  TABLE(S) | FILE  |
|---|---|
| 2  | Experiment_PW_m5.txt  | 
| 3,6,7  | Experiment1_m5_gamma_005.txt  | 
| 3,6,7  | Experiment1_m10_gamma_005.txt   |  
|  4 | Experiment_PW_m10.txt  | 
| 5  |  Experiment_PW_PWData.txt         |
| 6,7  | Experiment1_m15_gamma_005.txt  | 
| 6,7  | Experiment1_m20_gamma_005.txt   |
| 8  | Experiment_DKWT_vs_algo5_v1.txt  | 
| 9   | Experiment_DKWT_vs_algo5_v2.txt  | 

- The results for (B) are only shown in the terminal and not saved to any file.
